Hooray! We organized our first event as *ReactJS Istanbul* on February 27 at [Workup at Kolektif House](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Workup+by+T%C3%BCrkiye+%C4%B0%C5%9F+Bankas%C4%B1/@41.0797617,29.0086281,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7e65f3c2b07ec5a9?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiGw5e_s6voAhVwn-AKHeyrC0sQ_BIwEXoECBAQCA). 

We had two talks. My talk was titled **Functional components with hooks**. You can watch it below on Youtube (it's Turkish). Also you can find the presentation here: [hooks.wunnle.dev](https://hooks.wunnle.dev/)

I always worked remotely, so I didn't know much about what developers in my own city are interested in. That's why I was surprised that there was so much interest in React event I recently attended in Istanbul. This gave me the idea of creating a community focused on React for people in Istanbul.

So, [ReactJS Istanbul](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Istanbul/) was born! It's a new meetup group for React developers in Istanbul to network, share their experiences and learn more from each other. Our focus will be on both React and React based frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js.

We'll have [our first meeting on the 5th of February](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Istanbul/events/268165597/) at Walter's Coffee in Moda.

I've always worked remotely, so I didn't know much about the interests of developers in Istanbul. That's why I was surprised that there were so many developers in a React event I recently attended. This gave me the idea of creating a React community for people in my city.

So, [ReactJS Istanbul](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Istanbul/) was born! It's a new meetup group for React developers in Istanbul to network, share their experiences, and learn more from each other. Our focus will be on both React and React based frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js.

We'll have [our first meeting on the 5th of February](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Istanbul/events/268165597/) at Walter's Coffee in Moda.

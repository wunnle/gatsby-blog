# Gatsby blog

My personal blog on [wunnle.com](https://wunnle.com/) built with Gatsby. It uses markdown files as database and converts them to posts using gatsby-transformer-remark. 

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn start`, and open https://localhost:8000.


## Open source

As well as the code, the blog posts are also in this repo. You can find them in /src/posts.
